# BIOS14
All of my classwork for Lund University's BIOS14: Processing and Analyzing Biological Data

*eulaema.R* -----
Analysis of a dataset concerning the species of bee _Eulaema Nigrita_.
The plots produced by this script are produced in the same order as they appear in the assignment. The scaling may be off if the graphs are exported instead of viewed in the built-in plot viewer in R-Studio.

*chamois.Rmd* -----
Analysis of a dataset concerning the Chamois mountain goats of Southern Europe. Specifically, I'm interested in the patterns of horn length, especially in relation to time.
